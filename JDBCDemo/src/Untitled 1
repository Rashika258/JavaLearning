When you are using JDBC outside of an application server, the DriverManager class manages the establishment of connections.

Specify to the DriverManager which JDBC drivers to try to make Connections with. The easiest way to do this is to use Class.forName() on the class that implements the java.sql.Driver interface. With MySQL Connector/J, the name of this class is com.mysql.jdbc.Driver. With this method, you could use an external configuration file to supply the driver class name and driver parameters to use when connecting to a database.

1. Statement : 
It is used for accessing your database. Statement interface cannot accept parameters and useful when you are using static SQL statements at runtime. If you want to run SQL query only once then this interface is preferred over PreparedStatement. 

Example – 

//Creating The Statement Object  
Statement GFG = con.createStatement();
  
//Executing The Statement  
GFG.executeUpdate("CREATE TABLE STUDENT(ID NUMBER NOT NULL, NAME VARCHAR)"); 

2. PreparedStatement : 
It is used when you want to use SQL statements many times. The PreparedStatement interface accepts input parameters at runtime. 
 

Example –  

//Creating the PreparedStatement object 
PreparedStatement GFG = con.prepareStatement("update STUDENT set NAME = ? where ID = ?");
  
//Setting values to place holders  
//Assigns "RAM" to first place holder
GFG.setString(1, "RAM");   
          
//Assigns "512" to second place holder
GFG.setInt(2, 512);     
 
//Executing PreparedStatement
GFG.executeUpdate();
